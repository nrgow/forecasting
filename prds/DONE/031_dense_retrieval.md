I'd like you to build a small dense retrieval tool similar to the BM25 retrieval tool.
Um here are the two uh libraries that we'll use. Luxical is the embedding generator, and LEANN is the vector storage.
libraries/LEANN
libraries/luxical
So those are local clones of the projects that you can uh read the readme from and also take a look at the code and to understand how best to integrate these two projects into the dense retrieval tool.
