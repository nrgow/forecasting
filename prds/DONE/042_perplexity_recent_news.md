So I'd like a new news relevance module
So currently we have essentially a three stage pipeline. The first is the generation of present timelines. Then there's the generation of uh relevant news as additional context coming from G Delt. And then there's the future timeline generation.
We just implemented a new version of the present timeline generation that uses perplexity.
So what this new news irrelevance module should do is the following. Firstly, for all active event groups it should check when was the most recent present timeline generated.
Then it should simply make a new LLM call to open router to a perplexity model and ask to summarise the news since the generation of that present timeline until the present. And that summary of the news should be in a timeline format.
Right, so there are two options. The first case no relevant news summary exists. Then it should, as described, take as its starting point the generation time of the present timeline.
The second case is if a relevant news summary timeline does exist, then it should take as its starting point the generation time or the end point of the most recent relevant news summary timeline.
So the idea is that we are accumulating um a sequence of timelines. The first element of the timeline is the present timeline that gets generated once. And then as time progresses, there will be a sequence of these news relevance timelines. Um the idea is that these are faster and cheaper to generate than the present timeline. So we're gonna use a different model to generate these news relevance um kind of sub-timelines.
The model we should use is this: openrouter: perplexity/sonar
So importantly, um the prompts for this news timeline summary should basically ask to summarise the news since the it's you know applicable starting point in a timeline format. And if there's no relevance news, um it can simply state that there was there were no major updates.
