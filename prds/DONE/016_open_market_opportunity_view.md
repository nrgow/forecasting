So this is the point where we actually get to um selecting opportunities that are tradeable.
What we want is a view in the UI of all open markets for which we have generated and evaluated simulations and calculated the probability of that event happening at the specific time indicated by the open market.
So the view can be a table consisting of the title of the open market, the current price or probability of the uh of the event happening as defined by the outcome prices coming from polymarkets. And then finally the um our estimated probability of that open market resolving to true.
The final column will indicate the magnitude of the deviation between those two probabilities.
