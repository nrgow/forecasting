So the news relevance classifier that's currently used in run pipeline needs to have some pre-filtering applied before sending the news to the LLM for relevance classification.
We will need to first apply the zero shot classifier in news enrichment module. 
I think we can expand the class name from the default, which is currently I think international politics, and we can just add a few terms to the class name: international politics, geopolitics, world financial markets. And these can all be simply added as a s uh the class name with no punctuation.
Exactly. So we apply this zero shot classifier first. So we do the setup and clean up methods when it's finished. And make sure that only the um only the news items that have a pro a configurable probability, but I would say the probability greater than zero point five of belonging to this class, only those news items should be sent to the news relevance classifier.
For news items that do not pass this first filter, we can still save them and save the output of the zero shot classifier along with the news item. Um just so that we don't lose that um computation that uh that we do. So we don't want to have to re-compute it in the future, but rather saving it, just not applying the LLM relevance. In fact we yeah, that's it.
