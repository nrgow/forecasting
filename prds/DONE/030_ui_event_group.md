So in the UI, we currently display um three similar boxes or elements. The first is open markets, the second is market probabilities, and the third is open forecaster estimates.
Okay, firstly the open markets box um for the question um I'd like the the the text of the question to actually be a hyperlink to jump uh straight to the polymarkets um URL for that open market
Secondly, the market probabilities box um currently doesn't actually show the the the current price of the open markets. Right. It shows the probability coming from our simulations, but it doesn't actually show the current market price implied probability. So the market probabilities element should show the market price uh or market prices in case of multiple open markets.
Next, for the simulation based probabilities, that should be extracted into its own separate element showing the simulation implied probability coming as the average from multiple simulations, and then it should show the number of samples and the time generated, but that should be in a separate element, separate from the element that displays the actual market probabilities.
