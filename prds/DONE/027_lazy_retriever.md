So currently for the news relevance calculation, um we're effectively doing an eager evaluation of news relevance. That is to say we're trying to check every single document if they could be relevant. Um that's a two-step pipeline using zero shot classifier and then an LLM new news relevance um thing. So I'd like to also have the option to do things slightly differently. Um so instead having a deep search agent that is capable of querying uh BM25 index of all of the new news documents and finding which ones are relevant in a more on demand manner.

So this is the BM25 project that we should use. And you can take a look at that and add it to the project.
The deep search agent should be a DSPY module that basically has access to the BM25 index as a tool. And it should exactly so it should be I think maybe just a chain of thought that allows for you know interacting with the index and um you know expanding certain queries, trying certain key terms, and maybe importantly because queer query expansion will be important, but I think that the present timelines that we've already generated will be a useful resource for the deep search agents to leverage in order to understand what key terms might be fruitful in its search. So I think maybe at first we can simply just put the the the current present timeline into the prompt for the deep search agent and allow it to just um interpret that by itself.
So it should be configurable at the level of run_pipeline.py, whether we use this uh uh agentic retrieval based approach for finding relevant articles, or if we use the eager um approach which which tries to classify all news articles.
