For the future timeline generation, I would like to have as a default using the Grok free fast, which is already specified at temperature zero point seven, but add an additional configuration or argument that controls the number of generations that should be made for that model at that temperature.
So I think ten generations should be the default.
And I think the important thing is that um when we're requesting a certain number of generations, I'm not sure if it's necessary to to if there's a parameter in DSPY that allows us to make multiple generations. Or if we have to or if there's a parameter in light LLM that can be passed uh via the DSPY module. Um or if we somehow have to manually set a seed for the generation in order to um get multiple uh different generations but so you're gonna have to need to uh work that out.
