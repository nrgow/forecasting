So take a look at the model in the link provided. We'd like to integrate this um as an additional method of generating uh market probabilities.
Um so the example of prompting So we'll need to construct a prompt in the format as uh depicted in the link provided.
But as mentioned in the link, um because we're going to be talking about uh very recent events, I'd like to be able to include the present timelines that were just uh that are being generated in this project. So those present timelines should be um I suppose pre appended to the prompt maybe wrapped in some XML tags uh at first. So exactly.
Um in terms of implementation details, uh inference details, we can simply uh use the model as uh as a hugging face uh inference pipeline, just like in the in the link. Um with the exception or the only caveat being that we should make sure to load the model in a BF sixteen, B float sixteen. Um which may be the default, but if it's not, we should we should load it like that.
So in terms of storage. I think that the uh the let's say analyses that are generated by this model should be stored as let's say a separate data type in a separate file or um in the storage. It should be displayed differently in in a in an additional uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh let's say whatever elements in the UI. So exactly so we'd want a UI implementation. And that's uh kind of in addition to the existing current probability estimation. And uh the API should also deliver uh the data um for whatever uh event groups and and open markets we've generated these these analyses for.
Maybe before doing the UI and API integration work, I'd like to see what this model would generate for the current active event groups, including the present timelines that we've generated. And not only the present timelines, but also the recent relevant news for the the corresponding event group. So exactly. So just try and make some generations using this model and maybe as an endpoint in the main in the and in the main new script, um, just so that I can eyeball these uh answers that would be generated um uh before proceeding with the UI implementation work.
