The current news relevance pipeline is still too slow. We do zero shot classification as a first step of filtering, and then we do LLM based news relevance judgment. But there are simply too many items being sent to the LLM based news relevance. So I'd like you to come up with a plan ideally with some kind of evaluations to be able to be sure that this system works including semantic deduplication or near duplicate grouping.
