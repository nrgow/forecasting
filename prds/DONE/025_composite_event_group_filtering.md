So on the event group page in the UI. I would like currently we show things like the the total volume for all open markets in the event group. We currently show the the sum liquidity for all the markets of the event group and we show the uh the scoring that comes uh from our uh geopolitics classifier. So what I'd like to implement on the Python side and include and save in the storage um is something like a composite metric that allows um sorting in the UI that incorporates the volume liquidity and the uh theme based classifier probability and maybe the make sure maybe we also want to see as a separate column the twenty-four hour volume and include that in the composite uh metric. So yeah, come up with the composite metric and that ranks high event groups which have a very high thematic score, and that have high volume and have also I guess a high liquidity.
