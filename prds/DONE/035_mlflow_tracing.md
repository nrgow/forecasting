So I would like to use ML flow for tracing and tracking the different parts of the pipeline. So every model inference call should be logged to ML flow. You know, whether it's a zero shot or whether it's uh the re ranker and these should all be logged, including whatever metadata needs to be included, run ID, news ID, event group ID. So I want to see the inputs and the outputs in ML flow. And then additionally any LLM call, whether it's the present or future timeline construction. I also want to have that tracked in ML flow. Seeing the prompt seeing the outputs. Exactly. And and ML flow should run in a Docker container, Docker Compose together with uh an SQL database, probably Postgres.
