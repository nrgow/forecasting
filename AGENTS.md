- The Python part of the project is managed with `uv`. Dependencies can be added via `uv add` and code should be run by `uv run`.
- In Python, when writing a class or method, always add a short docstring.
- Avoid defensive programming. Prefer dict[key] over dict.get(key, ""). Allow errors to propagate rather than trying to silently repair errors.
- In Python, especially in data pipelines, generally prefer to add some simple logs before some module is called, indicating what module is being called, and when the module is finished, logging how long it took, and maybe summarizing how many items it processed.
